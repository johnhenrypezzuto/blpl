Betsy Levy Paluck Lab R Package


This package is a collection of functions I wrote during my time as lab manager to facilitate transparent social science. This is a place where lab members can share code and functions they have written together, and while practically learning how to contribute to open-source software.

Currently the bulk of this package is used at reformatting LaTeX tables in R usign regular expressions and running together many models at the same time.











To install:
```
install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("johnhenrypezzuto/blpl")
```
